    description: `Many Private and Government Organisations are facing a huge problem of Managing the files securely without leaking any sensitive information of the user, citizens and patients. It is a very difficult task for them as the tools available in the market like google drive, onedrive are saving the data in their clouds which is often unwanted by the organizations regarding the concern of security breach. Also after uploading a certain amount of files, these services ask for a certain amount of money to continue with their services which make them unaccessable for small Organizations. This project thus solve the problem of many organizations like educational and health institutes providing free file management and search optimization feature even from images totally offline thus providing 'In Home personal use' feature.

    This tool helps us to retrieve textual data from thousands of documents. This idea is not restricted to files only; we can also extract textual content from the images uploaded to this tool. The search engine will help us search for data inside files like pdfs, doc files, CSV files, jpeg files, etc. It will help to maintain and organize the files and ease searching within the files. In this way, we do not have to manually search every file for the specific text that we want.`,
